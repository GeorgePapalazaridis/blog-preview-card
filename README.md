## **Overview**

This project is a **responsive blog preview card** designed to showcase essential web development concepts. It features a clean, visually appealing layout that adjusts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The styles are built with **Sass** for modular, reusable, and maintainable CSS.

---

## **Features**

- **Semantic HTML5** for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Sass** for organized and modular styling with variables, mixins, and nesting.
- **Mobile-first workflow** ensuring optimal design for smaller screens.
- Fully responsive layout for devices ranging from 320px to 1440px.
- Google Fonts integration for custom typography.
- Accessible features such as descriptive `alt` attributes, `time` elements, and ARIA labels.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for a well-structured and accessible layout.
- **Sass (SCSS)**:
  - Custom properties (`--variables`) for maintainable styling.
  - `@use` for modular imports and reusable styles.
  - Nesting and mixins for organized and efficient CSS.
- **Google Fonts**: [Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) for modern typography.

---

## **Responsive Design**

The layout adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile (375px - 768px)**: Compact and optimized view with larger font sizes.
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Balanced layout with optimized spacing.
- **Desktop (1024px - 1440px)**: Centered and proportionate design.
